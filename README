To run the project Redis server should be 
launched at 127.0.0.1:6379

Server handles POST requests on /echoAtTime
Required params (application/json):
    message: String
    date: valid date String

Some work principles:
    - server runs on Express just for possible maintability purposes
    - for handling redis - node-redis module is used
    - each request shedules a message in a redis Sorted Set with score - date
    - on startup server checks if there are entites in the set, which timeout
        is already passed. It prints their messages and deletes the enitites
        from redis
    - for scheduling node-schedule module is used. For memory consumption 
        purposes only one task at a time is scheduled - the most recent 
        message to be printed. After it is printed the new task is scheduled - 
        the next message in a Set. And so on. 
    - server validates input data
    - only one redis store is used, so multiple clones of processes will handle
        the same redis entity
    - if date, that is passed as parameter is less than the current date, the
        message is processed withoud being added to redis
